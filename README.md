# F1_Data_Analysing_RCM

Formula 1 Data Analysis using the FastF1 API

This project aims to analyze Formula 1 data using the FastF1 API. The FastF1 API is a Python package that makes it easy to access and analyze Formula 1 data.

The project will use the FastF1 API to access a variety of Formula 1 data, including:

Race results
Qualifying results
Practice results
Telemetry data
Driver data
Team data
The project will then use this data to perform a variety of Formula 1 data analysis tasks, such as:

Identifying the fastest drivers and teams
Analyzing driver and team performance over time
Identifying trends in Formula 1 racing
Developing predictive models for Formula 1 races
The project is still under development, but the goal is to create a comprehensive and informative resource for Formula 1 fans and data scientists alike.

Potential use cases

The project's findings could be used by fans to better understand the sport, and by bookmakers to set odds on races.
