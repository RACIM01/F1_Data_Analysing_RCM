Formula 1 Data Analysis using the FastF1 API

This project aims to analyze Formula 1 data using the FastF1 API. The FastF1 API is a Python package that makes it easy to access and analyze Formula 1 data.

The project will use the FastF1 API to access a variety of Formula 1 data, including:

Race results
Qualifying results
Practice results
Telemetry data
Driver data
Team data
The project will then use this data to perform a variety of Formula 1 data analysis tasks, such as:

Identifying the fastest drivers and teams
Analyzing driver and team performance over time
Identifying trends in Formula 1 racing
Developing predictive models for Formula 1 races
The project is still under development, but the goal is to create a comprehensive and informative resource for Formula 1 fans and data scientists alike.

Potential use cases

The project's findings could be used by Formula 1 teams to improve their performance, by fans to better understand the sport, and by bookmakers to set odds on races.

Contributing

This project is open source and anyone is welcome to contribute. If you are interested in using the FastF1 API to analyze Formula 1 data, I encourage you to fork this repository and start coding!
